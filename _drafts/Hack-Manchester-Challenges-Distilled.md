Hack Manchester is an annual hack event which takes place in the heart of Manchester at the Museum of Science and Industry. 
Hundreds of people decend on Manchester to spend 25 hours coding up the best solution they can come up with to the challenges
set by the sponsors, in the hope to win a flurry of prizes up for grabs.
