# TypeScript *Is Great*

I've started to use TypeScript in my recent projects, and I'm having a blast using it. As you may already know, 
I write [nearly all my out-of-work personal projects](https://github.com/Codesleuth?tab=repositories) in JavaScript, and usually as Node.js modules.
There are many reasons why I use it over vanilla JavaScript, even though I consider myself adept with the language and its features (pains).
