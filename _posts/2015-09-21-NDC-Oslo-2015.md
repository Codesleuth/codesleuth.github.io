We're very lucky [developers at Esendex](http://www.esendex.co.uk/careers) to be able to pick any conference we would like to go to, once a year. We're limited by a shared budget, of course, but this year I was very privileged to go to [NDC Oslo](http://ndcoslo.com/) for a full three days.

I've been to Oslo before, which certainly helped me get around; but the city still amazed me *despite* the conference. However, the conference was the main attraction and it did not disappoint me. I only wish I wasn't suffering from a horrible cold during my time there - I may have enjoyed it even more!

# The Journey

I don't appreciate travel. I'm a large person at 198cm tall, and the build to match. So when I travel, I try prepare in advance by booking extra leg-room seats on both planes and trains. Unfortunately, it wasn't available for me this time, and I paid the price.

After enduring the flight, I had an early night at the hotel to prepare for my crazy first day at the conference.

The [Oslo Spektrum](http://www.oslospektrum.no/) arena is a huge place, enough to fit 9 tracks of almost continuous content throughout the day. Some of the stages were suspended from the ceiling, to make use of the space on the high seating areas!

## Food and Drink

No matter where you turn, there's something to eat, or something to sip on. I stuffed myself with hot dogs and pancakes mostly, and drank *way too much coffee* which seemed to be the default choice for most sponsors.

The first day ended with a boat party (a.k.a. The Shrimp Boat) and a tour around the Oslo Fjord. I managed to sneak onto the boat and met with Mike Amundsen who was giving a talk on Friday entitled "[Learning Client Hypermedia from the Ground Up]({{ "/notes/ndcoslo2015/Learning-Client-Hypermedia-from-the-Ground-Up.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})" which was already on my list of talks to go to. I also met [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson), the [inventor of hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext), which was pretty awesome!

## Party

At the end of day two the conference turned into a party with free beer and bands on stage, preceded by the closing keynote speaker James Mickens with "[Not Even Close: The State of Computer Security]({{ "/notes/ndcoslo2015/Not-Even-Close-The-State-of-Computer-Security.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }})".

I saw [Ida Maria BÃ¸rli Sivertsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Maria) for the first time; didn't know who she was but it was *okay* I guess - the acoustics were terrible, but I guess that's all the nerds stood in front of the speakers.

## Last Day

Friday seemed like a deflated day at the conference; many people hung over or just even more quiet than usual. The city was also quiet as I made my way over from my hotel, which was pretty nice to see.

I entered a few competitions and won a drone too! Although it's pretty terrible, and smaller than the palm of my hand, it was fun until Steven flew it into a BBQ. Thanks mate.

It wasn't long before it was the end of the day at around 4pm. I was feeling envigorated having started to get over my cold from the days before, and I wasn't ready for it all to end.

# Summary

The conference was a blast, and there were some great talks. I can say that it has definitely changed the way I think about a few things, and my colleagues would probably curse at how true that is. I recommend the conference to any developer wishing to either broaden their horizons or someone who has a subject they wish to focus on - there's a track to suit everyone's needs.

I've not spoken about the talks here, specifically, because you can see how much I liked them from the notes below. At the very least, I want to shout out to Sam Newman and his talk "[Principles Of Microservices]({{ "/notes/ndcoslo2015/Principles-Of-Microservices.html" | prepend: site.baseurl}})" which I believe will set you off on the right track on what microservices are and what they can do for you.

# Notes

I'm a fan of keeping notes from the talks I see at conferences. They help me remember the good parts of the talk, especially when I present my visit to my colleagues.
For each of the talks, I've prepared a notes page, each with an embedded video of the talk.

Some of the notes are missing, probably because I didn't take notes for that particular talk or I've not typed them up yet (coming soon). All videos but one are available; click through to see them.
