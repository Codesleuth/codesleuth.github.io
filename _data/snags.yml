            Water meter on street is flooded.
            
            If the water freezes, this will likely burst the mains water supply. The other houses also have this problem.
        - >
            Dents in wood floor panels.
            The dents Includes a large chip in the kitchen against the cabinets.
        - Door under stairs catching on frame
        - Dishwasher door panel catching against frame
        - Second floor bedroom small radiator does not work
      completed:
        - Underfloor heating is weak and pump is loud - Advised this can be turned up and down
        - Living room door is hung so that it swings - We've installed a magnetic door stop and are happy to leave it working as is
        - Outside tap doesn't work - We discovered the mains switch inside and the pump switch outside. The system works well.
        - >
            Fire alarms on first and second floor.
            
            These have never shown a green light to indicate mains power, which means there's no mains supplying them. Both alarms on ground floor are lit green and can be turned off with the mains switch, but there's no change for the other two alarms.
        - >
            Kitchen waste pipe.
            
            Kitchen waste pipe behind fitted kitchen cabinets is fitted so that water does not drain, and is sitting in the pipe. This causes the kitchen sink to pop and waste water to come back up into the sink when the washing machine and dishwasher are emptying, and after pouring sufficient water down the sink at once. Sagging pipes of standing water could break and cause another leak with damage that will be very difficult to repair.

            The work which fixed the first leak required breaking a hole in the back of the cupboard (which was pictured in the previous email). We were told a replacement panel is on order, but we've not been contacted about this since. What's the status of it?
        - >
            Bedroom window does not seal to frame.
            
            The left-most window in the front bedroom on the first floor closes but does not seal against the frame. This leaves a gap, which allows air to flow freely around the window frame.
        - >
            Ceiling and wall chips.
            
            Various small ceiling and wall defects with patches of paint missing or loose. Same problem in the cupboard atop the stairs on second floor.
        - >
            Second floor bath leaking.
            
            When using the shower, water emerges from the bottom of the bath as if the taps are not sealed and water is escaping behind the bath.
        - >
            Bedroom window catches when closed.
            
            Rear first floor bedroom right-hand window catches when closed, and cannot be placed open on the latch. It looks like the door is seated too low and the bolts catch against the lock when attempting to close it.
        - Kitchen door catching on frame 
        - Second floor door catching on frame
        - First floor bathroom lock latch does not lock
        - Missing key for balcony doors
        - Second floor bath cover loose and not sealed
        - Leaking waste pipe behind kitchen cabinets
