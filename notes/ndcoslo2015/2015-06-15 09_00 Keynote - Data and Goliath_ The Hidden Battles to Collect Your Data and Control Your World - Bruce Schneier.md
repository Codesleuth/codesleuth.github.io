* We produce data and it’s easy to save it…

* The metadata of our data is easier to analyse than the data

* Metadata is a side effect
 * Covert
 * Not obvious
 * Not noticed
 * Hard to opt-out

*“Data is the exhaust”*

* Ubiquitous
	* Happens everywhere

* Hops in connections between individuals lead to a web of loops

* “If you’re not the customer, you’re the product”

* Everyone expected the web to be free…

* Personalisation is more surveillance data

* Google knows more about you than you do
	* “Google knows what kind of porn you like”

* You wouldn't carry a GPS device from the government but you carry a phone with GPS tracking syncing to Google

* Fear is the driver for surveillance
	* But, data = power

* We must/need:
	* separate espionage from surveillance
	* comprehensive data protection laws
	* ubiquitous encryption
		* encryption forces the listener to target an individual
		* prevents the listener from eavesdropping on everyone, only the few
	* to value our privacy

* How do we design systems that protect us socially?

* Benefits of social surveillance exist
	* Google Maps traffic is crowd sourced from all users
		* Great for groups
		* Bad for the individual

*“Metadata is the pollution”*
