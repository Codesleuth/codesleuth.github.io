# NDC Oslo 2015
## Learning from Haskell
*by Venkat Subramaniam*

* Polyglot developers are more adventurous
	* Know different, therefore think different

* Why Haskell?
	* one of the most statistically typed languages
	* one of the most strictly functional languages

*"C++ is sadly typed"*

* Static typing does not have to suck
	* type inference!
	* polymorphic types!

* Languages should work for us, not the other way around

	* list values, ranges, skipping
	* head/tail/init/last/take

* Tuples

* Expressions over statements
	* Statements have side effects
	* Expressions do not have to have side effects
	* Less void
	* Less mutability

* Currying (e.g. blind closures)
	* Can be used in C# and JavaScript
	* Get used to it

* Be more lazy
	* Use C# Lazy type more to reduce overhead

* Expression scopes
	* Functional expressions

* Infinite series with `yield returns` already available in C#!
